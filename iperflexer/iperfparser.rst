The IperfParser
===============
.. module:: iperflexer.iperfparser

This is the class that performs the work of extracting the data-column.




The `IperfParser` extracts a column from the iperf-output. Currently it only extracts bandwidths or data-transfers. Either it needs to be made more flexible (or a better idea might be to create a family of column extractors). The `IperfParser` is differentiated from the `SumParser` in that it re-adds adds the parallel threads and in-fills zeros for missing time-intervals.

.. warning:: The ``intervals`` and ``transfer_intervals`` are defaultdict objects. This was done so that if an expected interval is missing then a 0 will be returned. As a side, effect, though, if you ask for an interval that didn't exist, you will always get 0, even if it is outside of the range of the data.

Properties
----------

bandwidths
~~~~~~~~~~

This is a generator of values from `IperfParser.intervals` in the sorted order of the keys (intervals). It is based on the premise that `IperfParser.intervals` is a dictionary whose keys are the start of the iperf sample intervals. e.g if the samples are reported at 1-second intervals then the keys are traversed :math:`0.0, 1.0,\ldots`.

.. note:: The name of the property suggests that the dictionary values are `bandwidths` but if this class is generalized to extract other columns then this will no longer be true and should be changed.

regex
~~~~~

This is a dictionary holding the regular expressions for the csv-format and the human-readable format. The keys should be accessed through ``iperfexpressions.ParserKeys`` (e.g. ``self.regex[ParserKeys.human]`` to get the regular expression for the human-readable iperf output).
