The Unit Converter
==================

The unit converter is a table to convert Data Rates.

Unit Names and Constants
------------------------

This has gotten way too long. I should break it up.

Decimal Unit Names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are base-10 units. The intention is to use them to convert the iperf (goodput) output so the strings themselves have to match the units iperf uses. Bit to make it easier to remember I'm aliasing them with long-names as well.

Base Converter
--------------

The `BaseConverter` is a dictionary that holds conversions. It defaults to base-10 units. It takes two arguments, `to_units` a list of units that will be used as the keys for the inner dictionaries that return the conversion factors. It has to be a list that has bit-units in the first half and byte-units in the second half. The other argument (`kilo_prefix`) is used to make the conversions. For memory-related data it should be :math:`2^{10}` and for network-related data it should be :math:`10^{3}`. Because the conversions are calculated as powers of the `kilo_prefix`, the `to_units` list has to have the correct order (e.g, bits, kbits, mbits, etc.). If you were to put them in the wrong order or skip a unit then the keys would no longer match the conversion factor (for at least some of the units).

Inheritors should call 'build_conversions' in their constructor for backward compatibility with the original UnitConverter which did built th dictionary in the constructor. This call was pulled out of the `BaseConverter` so that the arguments could be set by the inheritors before calling `build_conversions`. It's kind of ugly but I didn't plan on needing more than one converter.

The UnitConverter
-----------------

The `UnitConverter` is an instance of the BaseConverter that uses the base-10 system.

   UnitConverter


Decimal To-Units List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
The `decimal_to_units` list defines the valid conversions for the `UnitConverter`

::

    bit_units = [UnitNames.bits,
                 UnitNames.kbits,
                 UnitNames.mbits,
                 UnitNames.gbits,
                 UnitNames.terabits,
                 UnitNames.petabits,
                 UnitNames.exabits,
                 UnitNames.zettabits,
                 UnitNames.yottabits]
    
    byte_units = [UnitNames.bytes,
                  UnitNames.kbytes,
                  UnitNames.mbytes,
                  UnitNames.gbytes,
                  UnitNames.terabytes,
                  UnitNames.petabytes,
                  UnitNames.exabytes,
                  UnitNames.zettabytes,
                  UnitNames.yottabytes]
    
    decimal_to_units = bit_units + byte_units
    
        
    



As noted above, the `UnitConverter` is a base-10 converter so it uses the `KILO` variable as its base.

::

    KILO = 10**3
    




.. note:: The meaning of the prefixes is different for the Transfer and the Bandwidth columns. The Transfer refers to binary data so it is in base-2 (e.g. `kilo` means :math:`2^{10}`) while Bandwidth is a network-value so it is in base-10 (`kilo` means :math:`10^3`). So this converter only works for Bandwidth.

DecimalUnitConverter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since the `UnitConverter` was created before I thought I needed a `BinaryUnitConverter` it was just called the `UnitConverter`. To keep from breaking the code that uses it I'll leave the name the same, but add an alias called the `DecimalUnitConverter` to make a less ambiguous name.

.. '

::

    DecimalUnitConverter = UnitConverter
    




The BinaryUnitConverter
-----------------------

The `BinaryUnitConverter` is meant for the Binary (base-2) prefixed values found in the `Transfer` column. The wikipedia page on `kibibytes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibibyte>`_ has information about what this is about. In a nutshell it's needed because the convention for memory is to interpret the prefixes (kilo, mega, etc.) as a power of 2 rather than a power of 10 the way networking conventions interpret them.

.. '

Binary To Units
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 'binary_to_units' define what the valid conversions are.

::

    to_bits = [BinaryUnitNames.bits,
               BinaryUnitNames.kibibits,
               BinaryUnitNames.mebibits,
               BinaryUnitNames.gibibits,
               BinaryUnitNames.tebibits,
               BinaryUnitNames.pebibits,
               BinaryUnitNames.exbibits,
               BinaryUnitNames.zebibits,
               BinaryUnitNames.yobibits]
    
    to_bytes = [BinaryUnitNames.bytes,
                BinaryUnitNames.kibibytes,
                BinaryUnitNames.mebibytes,
                BinaryUnitNames.gibibytes,
                BinaryUnitNames.tebibytes,
                BinaryUnitNames.pebibytes,
                BinaryUnitNames.exbibytes,
                BinaryUnitNames.zebibytes,
                BinaryUnitNames.yobibytes]
    
    binary_to_units = to_bits + to_bytes
    



The Base Prefix Converter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As noted above, this is a base-2 converter so all the unit converters are powers of 2. They use :math:`2^{10}` as their base.

::

    KIBI = 2**10
    



The BinaryUnitconverter Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. uml::

   BaseConverter <|-- BinaryUnitconverter

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api

   BinaryUnitconverter

The `BinaryUnitconverter` initializes its parent and then calls its `build_conversions` method.



The IperfbinaryConverter
------------------------

After creating the binary converter I realized that iperf doesn't use the bibyte naming convention. 

.. '

Iperf Binary To Units
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 'iperf_binary_to_units' define what the valid conversions are. Since the main idea is for this to be used to convert the Transfer column using the units given in the file I'm only changing the bytes-based names since Iperf always reports the output in bytes and I hope this will keep it less ambiguous. If conversions are being used outside of this case it's probably better to use the BinaryUnitConverter anyway.

.. note:: Iperf's `stdio.h` file seems to indicate that only units up to Gbits and GBytes are supported so I'm only guessing as to what the output might be if they change it.

::

    to_bits = [BinaryUnitNames.bits,
               BinaryUnitNames.kibibits,
               BinaryUnitNames.mebibits,
               BinaryUnitNames.gibibits,
               BinaryUnitNames.tebibits,
               BinaryUnitNames.pebibits,
               BinaryUnitNames.exbibits,
               BinaryUnitNames.zebibits,
               BinaryUnitNames.yobibits]
    
    to_bytes = [BinaryUnitNames.iperf_bytes,
                BinaryUnitNames.iperf_kibibytes,
                BinaryUnitNames.iperf_mebibytes,
                BinaryUnitNames.iperf_gibibytes,
                BinaryUnitNames.iperf_tebibytes,
                BinaryUnitNames.iperf_pebibytes,
                BinaryUnitNames.iperf_exbibytes,
                BinaryUnitNames.iperf_zebibytes,
                BinaryUnitNames.iperf_yobibytes]
    
    iperf_binary_to_units = to_bits + to_bytes
    



The Base 2 Prefix Converter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As noted above, this is a base-2 converter so all the unit converters are powers of 2. They use :math:`2^{10}` as their base.

The IperfbinaryConverter Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. uml::

   BaseConverter <|-- IperfbinaryConverter

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api

   IperfbinaryConverter

The `IperfbinaryConverter` initializes its parent and then calls its `build_conversions` method.




Example Use
-----------

The expected way to use this is to multiply your original value by the value returned by the converter. For instance, to convert from bits to Mbits you could do this.

::

    if __name__ == "__builtin__":
        unit_converter = UnitConverter()
        bits = 10**6
        converted = bits * unit_converter['bits']['Mbits']
        print("{0} Mbits".format(converted))
    
    

::

    1.0 Mbits
    
    



And to convert from Mebibytes to bits you could do this.

::

    if __name__ == "__builtin__":
        binary_converter = BinaryUnitconverter()
        MBytes = 1
        bits = MBytes * binary_converter[BinaryUnitNames.mebibytes][UnitNames.bits]
        print("{0:,} bits".format(bits))
    

::

    8,388,608 bits
    



That previous example was half-way to the original use-case for creating the `BinaryUnitConverter` -- converting the data-transferred to bits so that I could calculate the transferred Megabits.

::

    if __name__ == '__builtin__':
        mbits = bits * unit_converter[UnitNames.bits][UnitNames.mbits]
        print('{0} Mbits'.format(mbits))
    

::

    8.388608 Mbits
